<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<h4 id="requirements">Requirements:</h4>
<p><b>PHP</b><br>
<small>** NOTE that Plikli is NOT yet compatible with PHP version 7; It is in progress!</small></p>
<p>Plikli CMS has been tested on PHP version 5.4+. We have designed the Content Management System based on PHP 5.4+ technologies, so certain problems may occur when using older versions of PHP. We recommend that your server runs a minimum of PHP 5.4+.</p>
<p>If your server runs on PHP version higher than 5:
Check the cPanel under SOFTWARE -&gt; MultiPHP Manager. if it is available and you can select the PHP version you want, then set it. Otherwise, ask your host to install EasyApache so you can have access to MultiPHP Manager.</p>
<p><b>PHP Extensions</b></p>
<ul>
<li>cURL PHP</li>
<li>GD Graphics Library</li>
</ul>
<p><b>PHP Functions</b><br>
<small>Can be checked and set in cPanel under MultiPHP INI Editor.</small></p>
<ul>
<li>fopen (PHP Directive: allow_url_fopen)</li>
<li>file_get_contents (PHP Directive: allow_url_fopen)</li>
<li>fwrite (Function is used in conjunction with the fopen Function)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>MySQL</b></p>
<p>Plikli has been tested on both MySQL versions 4 and 5, during that process we have discovered that bugs will occasionally pop up if you are running MySQL 4. For this reason it is recommend that you use a server with MySQL 5.0.3+ or later to run a Plikli CMS website.</p>
<h4 id="troubleshooter">Troubleshooter:</h4>
<p>To test if your server is capable of running Plikli please view the "Troubleshooter". If any errors appear on that page you may have a problem with either installing or running Plikli.</p>
                <p style="color:#ff0000;">But, fear not, other than the requirement number 1 (Create a mysql database), Plikli Installation system will fix all the other requirements for you! The requirements listed below are just for your info and to get familiar with them and make sure that this is what you need to install Plikli CMS.</p>
                <p style="color:#ff0000;">Once you read the readme page, proceed to "Troubleshooter" in the navigation menu and follow the process that shows you the readiness to proceed with the installation. Once you have finished with the Troubleshooter, Click on the "Install" link in the navigation menu!</p>
<h4 id="install-steps">Install Steps:</h4>

<h3 id="upgrade">Upgrade</h3>
<h4 id="backup">Backup:</h4>
<ol>
                    <li>Log into your site as admin</li>
                    <li>Click on admin panel link</li>

                    <li>Delete the files from the backup manager</li>
                </ol>
<h4 id="version-verify">Version Verify:</h4>
                <p>For easy access, the Plikli Admin Panel's "Statistics" widget displays your Plikli CMS Version. Plikli stores your version number in a MySQL database under the plikli_misc_data table. If you have access to a tool to view your MySQL database, like PhpMyAdmin, you will find that the data is stored under the name "plikli_version". </p>
                <p>To upgrade to the latest version of Plikli CMS, make sure that you run the file /install/upgrade.php in your browser after uploading the latest version Plikli files to your server. If you forget to take this step your database may not be up to date with the latest version, causing the version number displayed in the Admin Panel to be incorrect.</p>
<h4 id="upgrade-steps">Upgrade Steps:</h4>
<div class="well">
                Please be sure to <strong>make a backup of your MySQL databases and files before upgrading</strong> to the latest version of Plikli. Some upgrades might require that you upgrade your MySQL database, so please make backups whenever upgrading.<br>
                These instructions do not support upgrading your template. Template upgrades require manual changes and should be carefully handled by the template author.<br>
                The directions below are recommendations that we have come up with to mininimize the number of problems that might come from upgrading your site.
                </div>
                <ol>
                    <li>Backup your MySQL database</li>
                    <li>Backup your old Plikli CMS files.</li>
                    <li>Rename your template folder so that the data is not overwritten by upgrade files. If you use a template name that is not included with Plikli, skip this step.</li>
                    <li> Disable all of the modules from your admin panel. <br>
                    You will need to re-enable them after upgrade.</li>
                    <li>Delete all of the files from your server EXCEPT:
                       <ol>
                           <li>/avatars/ (entire directory)</li>
                           <li>/libs/dbconnect.php</li>
                           <li>/favicon.ico</li>
                           <li>/settings.php</li>
                       </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>Upload all of the new files to your server. <br>
                    If you are able to, I suggest uploading a zip file to the server and extracting it server-side. This will minimize the chances of files being corrupted during FTP transfer, which is a common issue.<br>
                    </li><li>Confirm that the CHMOD permissions for the following files or directories are all set to 777.</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>/settings.php</li>
                            <li>/admin/backup/</li>
                            <li>/avatars/groups_uploaded/</li>
                            <li>/avatars/user_uploaded/</li>
                            <li>/cache/</li>
                            <li>/languages/ (and all of the content within this directory)</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Run the upgrade from /install/upgrade.php<br>
                        If there are no error messages, delete the /install directory from your web server.</li>
                    <li>Navigate to your homepage and log in as an "admin" level user.<br>
                        In some cases you may already be logged in from your previous version of Plikli.</li>
                    <li>Either update your template to work with the latest version or navigate to /admin/admin_config.php?page=Template and change the template name to "bootstrap"</li>
                    <li>Re-activate the disabled modules from step 4</li>
                </ol>
